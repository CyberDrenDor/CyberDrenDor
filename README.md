- 👋 Hi, I’m @CyberDrenDor
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning some basic programing to help deepen my understanding of how computers work and to perhaps even create a project of my own down the road.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I have been playing with Powershell scripting, mostly taking existing scripts and modifying them to suite my needs. I have also played with Visual Basic in MS Access databases a little bit.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... helping others by providing bug reports and such.
- 📫 How to reach me ... by email at orezon@hotmail.com
